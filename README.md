# trade-demo-journey-test-suite

Playwright test suite for the Trade Imports.

- user acceptance tests using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
- cross browser compatibility tests using [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/)
- security testing using [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)
- accessibility testing using [axe-core](https://www.deque.com/axe/)

## Requirements

This application is intended to be run in a Docker container to ensure consistency across environments.

Docker can be installed from [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker compose build
```

### Running local tests with Playwright

Run journey tests using Docker using [local Playwright configuration](./playwright.local.config.js).

Run standalone Playwright tests locally

```bash
npm run test
```

Run test within Docker container

```bash
npm run docker:test:local
```

### Running local tests with Playwright + BrowserStack

Run journey tests using Docker with [BrowserStack configuration](./playwright.local.browserstack.config.js).

```bash
npm run docker:test:local:browserstack
```

### Reporting

This test suite uses **Allure** for generating test reports that are compatible with the CDP Portal infrastructure. Allure provides:

- CDP Portal integration
- Historical test trends
- S3 publishing pipeline
- Enterprise reporting standards

The test configuration generates Allure reports in `allure-results/` (raw data) and can optionally publish to `allure-report/`(HTML report).

To publish the report run the following command after running the tests:

```bash
npm run report:publish
```

## Production

### Running the tests

Tests are run from the CDP-Portal under the Test Suites section. Before any changes can be run, a new docker image must be built, this will happen automatically when a pull request is merged into the `main` branch.
You can check the progress of the build under the actions section of this repository. Builds typically take around 1-2 minutes.

The results of the test run are made available in the portal.

## Requirements of CDP Environment Tests

1. Your service builds as a docker container using the `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
   The workflow tags the docker images allowing the CDP Portal to identify how the container should be run on the platform.
   It also ensures its published to the correct docker repository.

2. The Dockerfile's entrypoint script should return exit code of 0 if the test suite passes or 1/>0 if it fails

3. Test reports should be published to S3 using the script in `./bin/publish-tests.sh` in Allure format

## BrowserStack

Two Playwright configuration files are provided to help run the tests using BrowserStack in both a GitHub workflow (`playwright.github.browserstack.config.js`) and from the CDP Portal (`playwright.browserstack.config.js`).
They can be run from npm using the `npm run test:browserstack` (for running via portal) and `npm run test:github:browserstack` (from GitHub runner).
See the CDP Documentation for more details.

### Known Issues

BrowserStack compatibility with Playwright is still evolving.

As such, some compromises have been made based on risk

- BrowserStack support for Playwright page assertions such as `toHaveUrl`, `toHaveText` and `toHaveTitle` is currently inconsistent across devices. As a workaround, these assertions have been replaced with alternative matchers.

- BrowserStack support for all required device and browser combinations is not yet available meaning some are not currently tested. See the table below for details.

- Some Playwright locators fail to match accurately on Android devices. These assertions have been skipped for Android devices.

### Environment Variables

Before running BrowserStack tests, you need to set up the following environment variables added to a `.env` file in the root of the project:

```bash
BROWSERSTACK_USER=<your_browserstack_username>
BROWSERSTACK_KEY=<your_browserstack_access_key>
```

### GOV.UK Browser Requirements Coverage

For the complete list of browsers that GOV.UK services should support, see: [GOV.UK Service Manual - Designing for different browsers and devices](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices)

The table below shows which required browsers are tested by our BrowserStack configuration:

| Platform    | Browser          | BrowserStack Test | Notes         |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| **Windows** | Chrome           | ✅                |               |
| **Windows** | Edge             | ✅                |               |
| **Windows** | Firefox          | ✅                |               |
| **macOS**   | Safari           | ✅                |               |
| **macOS**   | Chrome           | ✅                |               |
| **macOS**   | Firefox          | ✅                |               |
| **iOS**     | Safari           | ❌                | Not supported |
| **iOS**     | Chrome           | ❌                | Not supported |
| **Android** | Chrome           | ❌                | Not supported |
| **Android** | Samsung Internet | ❌                | Not supported |

## Security Testing

This test suite includes ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) security testing integration. ZAP automatically scans for security vulnerabilities and integrates results with Allure reporting.

### Requirements

For local testing, ZAP must be running before tests execute:

```bash
docker compose up -d zap
```

The local test scripts (`npm run test:local`, `npm run test:local:debug` and `npm run test:local:browserstack`) automatically start ZAP before running tests.
